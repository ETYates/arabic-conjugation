This program is a partial implementation of a computational analysis of Arabic
conjugation by D. Bargelli and J. Lambek (cited below). With this program, 
every form of every Arabic verb should be generated. With this program, data
can be generated for use in linguistic annotation. 

TO DOs:
-Implement phonological rules for (t), and section symbol.
-Implement morphological rules for weak verbs. 
-Verify generated forms against pre-annotated data.
